To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.",

The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word \"leac\". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.\nLeeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.\n\nPlant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting.\n\nNewer cultivars have quicker maturity ‚Äì three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. \n\nLeeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks\nLeeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients.\n\nPlant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently.\n\nThe white part of the leek is edible; the green is not. You can blanch the stems to increase the proportion of stem that‚Äôs edible and to sweeten the taste. Do this to fully grown leeks. Tie a paper collar around each stem and gently hill the earth up around the stem. Be careful not to get soil between the paper collar and stem as the leek may rot.\nAs the plants grow, add another collar above the first one and hill up more soil. Be aware that slugs and snails can hide in the paper collars\n\nHarvest the leeks when stems are around 2.5cm in diameter. Dig carefully around the leek and lift with a garden fork. Do not pull, as the leek is likely to break.",

The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants. Peppers have an upright growing habit and can benefit from staking to help the plant support the fruits.",

Feijoa is grown for it's fruits, which resemble small guavas, and as an ornamental. Feijoas are best planted from grafted saplings (as opposed to starting from seed) and will mature into a sprawling shrub if not pruned. They can also be grown in containers. They will produce fruit within 3-4 years of being transplanted. Most Feijoas are not self-fertile. The bright red flowers require pollination by 2-3 Feijoa trees of another variety nearby. The small fruit are green, ellipsoid, and the size of an egg. They taste like a cross between pineapple, apple, and mint, and have a clear, gelatinous seed pulp at the center surrounded by a firmer, slightly gritty opaque flesh. The fruit is eaten raw or added to smoothies. The edible flower petals can be added to salads. Fruit is best when allowed to ripen on the tree. A tarp or large cloth can be hung around the tree to catch fruit when it falls and prevent bruising. Feijoa requires between 100-200 hours of chilling during the winter and produces tastier fruit at moderate summer temperatures between 25-32¬∞C. Summer temperatures above 32¬∞C can negatively affect fruit set. Feijoa is somewhat drought tolerant.",

The plant has smooth white bark, deeply lobed fragrant leaves, and multiple, spreading trunks. Flowers are often pollinated by fig wasps, and develop into 3-5cm long fruit with green skin that, depending on the variety, can ripen to a deep purple. Figs need to ripen fully on the tree before harvest. They are ripe when they droop and are soft to the touch. If they ooze a white sap when they are pulled from the tree, they are not ripe. Fig trees have an aggressive root system that searches for groundwater in aquifers, ravines, and cracks in rocks. Once established, they can tolerate seasonal drought and are affected by few pests. Figs are propagated through cuttings or division, and generally produce fruit the year after planting. In warmer climates, they can produce two crops, one in early summer, and the other in fall.",

It resembles mint, with triangular, coarse-toothed leaves, square stems, and small, pink, white, purple, or blue flowers. Like mint, it can become invasive, so it is best planted in containers. Catnip is used an ornamental, to make herbal tea, and as a companion plant. It is deer-resistant and attracts beneficial insects like bees and butterflies and deters pests like flea beetles, Japanese beetles, aphids, weevils, ants, squash bugs and mice. It also attracts cats because it contains the chemical nepetalactone, which can cause cats to enter a brief state of euphoria.",

    "description": "The peach tree is a deciduous tree native to Northwest China that produces stone, or drupe, fruits. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus because their stones are corrugated rather than smooth. Peaches and nectarines are the same species - nectarines have a recessive gene that makes their skin smooth rather than fuzzy. Cultivated peaches are divided into two groups: clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not. Peaches can have white or yellow fuzzy skin. Yellow peaches usually have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness. White peaches are very sweet with little acidity. Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 ¬∞C during the winter, and hot temperatures in the summer to ripen fruit. Some varieties are self-pollinating, while others require pollination by a peach tree of another variety with the same bloom period within 50 feet. Peaches should be thinned to 7-12cm apart when fruit are 2-3cm in diameter to increase mature fruit size. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 2-4 years of planting.",
