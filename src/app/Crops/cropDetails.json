The essential oil of the seeds is used in herbal remedies and dietary supplements, and to flavor liqueurs, gin, vermouth, tobacco, and perfumes. Cilantro is an annual herb in the Apiaceae family with soft leaves that are broadly lobed at the base of the plant and become slender and feathery higher up the stems. The leaves will be ready to harvest within 50-55 days, the seeds take up to 100 days to mature and then need to be dried.","row_spacing":15,"common_names":["coriander"," collender"," chinese parsley"," coriandro"," cilantro"," cilandrio"," culantro"," curatù"," coriandre"," dhania"],"guides_count":1,"binomial_name":"Coriandrum sativum","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors, transplant seedlings outside after hardening off","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59d7d7ea2af7270004000004.jpg?1507317736","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":60,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59d7d7ea2af7270004000004","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59d7d7ee2af7270004000005","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59d7d7f12af7270004000006","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afe37a3166630002961100/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"576b8edc92500900030000a2","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afe37a3166630002961100/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":49,"photo_associations_count":64,"plantings":[{"id":4267,"garden_id":4204,"crop_id":60,"planted_at":"2019-05-16","quantity":1,"description":"heirloom seeds from greenmylife","created_at":"2019-05-16T09:27:13.957Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T09:27:13.957Z","slug":"polkapink-pots-coriander","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":1781,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1781,"login_name":"polkapink","location":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"id":2251,"garden_id":188,"crop_id":60,"planted_at":"2014-10-26","quantity":1,"description":"Planted on south-facing balcony.\r\n\r\n2015-01-09: Much of the cilantro got eaten by some animal or another.","created_at":"2014-11-01T04:39:19.990Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T19:56:08.091Z","slug":"ypgarden-garden-coriander--2","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"seedling","owner_id":134,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":134,"login_name":"ypgarden","location":"Mountain View, CA","latitude":45.5073725,"longitude":-73.6050824}},{"id":276,"garden_id":39,"crop_id":60,"planted_at":"2013-04-16","quantity":1,"description":"1 pot.

The name \"rosemary\" derives from the Latin for \"dew\" (ros) and \"sea\" (marinus), or \"dew of the sea\". The plant is also sometimes called 'anthos', from the ancient Greek word ἄνθος, meaning \"flower\".

Retired the old plant.","created_at":"2013-05-12T03:19:39.833Z","updated_at":"2014-10-11T02:32:08.419Z","slug":"ypgarden-garden-rosemary","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"","owner_id":134,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":134,"login_name":"ypgarden","location":"Mountain View, CA","latitude":45.5073725,"longitude":-73.6050824}},{"id":2009,"garden_id":1569,"crop_id":180,"planted_at":"2014-03-01","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2014-09-16T14:57:27.990Z","updated_at":"2014-09-16T14:57:27.990Z","slug":"demands-garden-rosemary","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"advanced plant","owner_id":1263,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1263,"login_name":"demands","location":"Bushrod, Oakland, CA","latitude":37.8457009,"longitude":-122.263511178832}},{"id":2139,"garden_id":1715,"crop_id":180,"planted_at":"2014-04-14","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2014-10-08T19:16:55.131Z","updated_at":"2014-10-08T19:29:50.875Z","slug":"tchail-window-box-rosemary","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"advanced plant","owner_id":1379,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1379,"login_name":"tchail","location":"Nantes, France","latitude":47.2186371,"longitude":-1.5541362}},{"id":2337,"garden_id":1975,"crop_id":180,"planted_at":"2015-02-04","quantity":4,"description":"","created_at":"2015-02-04T06:32:48.060Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T06:32:48.060Z","slug":"nicolehilder-work-rooftop-garden-rosemary","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"cutting","owner_id":1525,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1525,"login_name":"nicolehilder","location":"Yarraville","latitude":-37.8180051,"longitude":144.8819389}},{"id":2518,"garden_id":1988,"crop_id":180,"planted_at":"2015-03-08","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2015-03-16T07:14:57.193Z","updated_at":"2015-03-16T07:14:57.193Z","slug":"marco_b-garden-rosemary","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"cutting","owner_id":1564,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1564,"login_name":"marco_b","location":"Melbourne","latitude":-37.8142176,"longitude":144.9631608}},{"id":2717,"garden_id":79,"crop_id":180,"planted_at":"2015-04-19","quantity":1,"description":"Tiny organic rosemary plant from the Takoma Park farmers market.

are a hybrid species of the genus Fragaria that produce sweet, bright red fruits. \n\nThere are three main types of strawberries: \n\n1) summer-fruiting: produce a single, large crop of fruit the year after planting. To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.","row_spacing":35,"common_names":["Aardbei","Fraisier","Erdbeere","Grandian F1"],"guides_count":6,"binomial_name":"Fragaria × ananassa","sowing_method":"Transplant bare root plants/plugs or divide runners","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/551dc6103732390003730100.jpg?1428014606","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"551dc6103732390003730100","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"5a2091b44ef55e0004000005","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"5a2091b94ef55e0004000006","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"5a2091bd4ef55e0004000007","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"5a2091c14ef55e0004000008","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54f578dc3361300003040000/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54f578dc3361300003040000/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":28,"photo_associations_count":61,"plantings":[{"id":3440,"garden_id":2479,"crop_id":203,"planted_at":"2016-09-03","quantity":6,"description":"damaged (frozen) by spring hail build up over the plants\r\n\r\nAdded more strawberry plants\r\n\r\n6/11/2017: put a bigger net over it. \r\n\r\n12/11/2017 something is eating the fruit before us.

is a cultivar of the species Brassica oleracea. It has green or purple leaves that branch off from one to multiple upright stems and do not form a head like cabbage. The plant is usually grown as an annual, but if grown as a perennial, it will form seeds in the second year. Current popular varieties include Curly kale, Italian kale, and Red Russian kale (green leaves with pale purple stems). It can be grown as baby salad greens or for bunching adult leaves. Leaves are sweeter after a frost and delicious eaten raw, added to salads, sautéed, or added to stews and casseroles.","row_spacing":45,"common_names":["Kale","leaf cabbage"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Brassica oleracea (acephala)","sowing_method":"Direct seed.

Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes.

Laid down a bed of about 6 inches organic potting soil (compost-rich) in the bottom of each barrel, then placed potato starts sprout-side up (white in one barrel, red in the other), across the surface.  Pressed each piece down slightly to ensure contact.  Then lightly scattered an additional inch or two of soil over the top to cover the sprouts, and sprinkled with water.  I plan to continue adding soil as needed to keep the main stem covered, until the plants nearly reach the top of the barrel -- then I'll let the vines grow, to gather energy for the tubers that will develop underground.

Hardneck)\r\nOur best Purple Stripe in performance year after year. A great cooking garlic, it retains  avor and texture. Very large bulbs that average 9 to 10 easy to peel cloves. From Shvelisi, Republic of Georgia. One of our best baking garlics.\r\n\r\n**MUSIC** (Porcelain - Hardneck)\r\nAn outstanding plant producing very large bulbs. A starchy-sweet garlic when baked. Hot when consumed raw.\r\n\r\n**METECHI** (Marbled Purple Stripe - Hardneck)\r\nPlants upright and broader leaved than others. Large capsule and bulbils. Cloves few, but large and fat, with blushed and lined skins. Tastes fiery raw, but with a nice  finish.\r\n\r\n**ASIAN TEMPEST** (Asiatic - Hardneck)\r\nFrom South Korea via Horace Shaw in Oregon. Beak on bulbil can reach 18 inches in length. This strain produces an outstanding crop. Sweet baked with good garlic  flavor. Breathtaking raw.\r\n\r\n**INCHELIUM RED** (Artichoke - Softneck)\r\nLarge bulbed vigorous strain; our best selling Artichoke. A top rated softneck at a 1990 taste test at Rodale kitchens. Discovered on the Colville Indian Reservation by Larry Geno; original source unknown. Four to five clove layers with 8 to 20 cloves. It seems to have higher soluble solids (denser, heavier bulbs) than other Artichokes. Mild,  flavorful.\r\n\r\n**SILVER WHITE** (Silverskin - Softneck)\r\nOriginally a California strain from Harmony Farm Supply. This large bulbed garlic has proven productive in both cold winter/hot summer and humid maritime climates. Our most productive Silverskin since 1992.\r\n\r\n**PERSIAN STAR** (Purple Stripe - Hardneck)\r\nVivid clove wrapper col- ors. Outer bulb wrapper sometimes smooth white, but inner wrappers purple streaked. Red-tipped cloves with marbled streaks on whitish or yellow-brown back ground. Very pleasant  flavor, mildly spicy but not too sharp. Purchased in Samarkand, at a Uzbekistan bazaar in the late 1980’s by John Swenson.\r\n\r\n**MONTANA ZEMO** (Porcelain - Softneck)\r\nOriginal source likely Zemo. This beautiful, large leafed porcelain strain is more vigorus than \"Zemo\", producing large, dense bulbs. Grown by Foothill Farm at the base of the Mission Mountains in NW Montana.\r\n\r\n**CHINA STRIPE** (Turban - Hardneck)\r\nDelicate purple stripes adorn this attractive bulb. Mild flavor. Purchased in Beijing market by G. Czarnecki.\r\n\r\n**RUSSIAN RED** (Marbled Purple Stripe - Hardneck)\r\nHas a flavor similar to Rocamboles in its complexity. Purple bulb wrappers. Clove wrappers are brown and purple.\r\n\r\n**RED TOCH** (Artichoke - Softneck)\r\nCollected in Rep. of Georgia by Hanelt about 1988, near the town of Tochliavri. Bulb wrappers streaked with red, pink and yellow . A very popular strain for good reason.\r\n\r\n**NOOTKA ROSE** (Silverskin - Softneck)\r\nA well colored strain; a Northwest heirloom from the San Juan Islands\r\noff the Washington coast. From Steve Bensel of Nootka Rose Farm in Waldron, WA. Cloves streaked pink on mahogany background with solid red clove tips. Colors fade in rich soil. Medium to large bulbs and very attractive braided. Strong flavor.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-26T16:21:59.217Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T16:24:10.770Z","slug":"heartlandgarlic-garden-garlic","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"bulb","owner_id":2107,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":2107,"login_name":"heartlandgarlic","location":"Mound City, Kansas","latitude":38.1428068,"longitude":-94.8135732}},{"id":3507,"garden_id":2462,"crop_id":87,"planted_at":"2016-11-28","quantity":2,"description":"","created_at":"2016-11-28T05:51:54.281Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T16:30:08.776Z","slug":"shiny-vege-garden-plot-1-garlic","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"bulb","owner_id":15,"finished":true,"finished_at":"2017-05-13","lifespan":166,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":15,"login_name":"shiny","location":"Wellington, NZ","latitude":-41.2887953,"longitude":174.7772114}},{"id":3806,"garden_id":2478,"crop_id":87,"planted_at":"2017-09-24","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2017-11-05T03:06:15.180Z","updated_at":"2018-01-07T09:28:15.330Z","slug":"shiny-bigger-vege-bed-garlic","sunniness":"","planted_from":"","owner_id":15,"finished":true,"finished_at":"2018-01-03","lifespan":101,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":15,"login_name":"shiny","location":"Wellington, NZ","latitude":-41.2887953,"longitude":174.7772114}},{"id":3034,"garden_id":2133,"crop_id":87,"planted_at":"2015-06-10","quantity":6,"description":"I think this was \"Western Rose\" variety.

They are grown for culinary and ornamental purposes. The scapes or stems are hollow and tubular and have a mild onion taste. They are one of the fines herbes of French cuisine and commonly used fresh. The plant forms dense clusters of slender 2-3cm bulbs, which can be cooked. Chive flowers are edible, star-shaped, and pale purple.

herb with a distinctive taste. It's stems are square-shaped and it has pink, purple, or white flowers. Peppermint, ginger mint, and large apple mint are hybrids of mint. Mint is often grown in pots to prevent it from overtaking the garden with its invasive, spreading rhizome root structure. It's leaves are most aromatic before the plant flowers and can be used fresh, dried, or frozen. Mint's strongly scented leaves confuse the pests of carrots, tomatoes, alliums, and brassicas, and deter flea beetles.","row_spacing":35,"common_names":["Mint","spearmint"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Mentha spicata / Mentha viridis","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors or

They can be white, yellow, and pale to deep purple. Some are as small as goose eggs. The 'Rosa Bianca' cultivar is squat and round, while Asian cultivars can be long and thin. Eggplant stems are often spiny and their flowers range from white to purple. \n\nTheir flesh is generally white with a meaty texture and small seeds in the center.

a vegetable, a cultivar of Allium ampeloprasum, the broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word \"leac\". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.\nLeeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.\n\nPlant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting.\n\nNewer cultivars have quicker maturity – three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. \n\nLeeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks\nLeeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients.\n\nPlant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently.\n\nThe white part of the leek is edible; the green is not. You can blanch the stems to increase the proportion of stem that’s edible and to sweeten the taste. Do this to fully grown leeks. Tie a paper collar around each stem and gently hill the earth up around the stem. Be careful not to get soil between the paper collar and stem as the leek may rot.\nAs the plants grow, add another collar above the first one and hill up more soil. Be aware that slugs and snails can hide in the paper collars\n\nHarvest the leeks when stems are around 2.5cm in diameter. Dig carefully around the leek and lift with a garden fork. Do not pull, as the leek is likely to break.","row_spacing":15,"common_names":["Leek","Prei","Poireau","Porree","Blauwgroene winter"],"guides_count":2,"binomial_name":"Allium porrum","sowing_method":"Direct seed or transplant seedlings","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/591b57fd1faea7000400000a.jpg?1494964215","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":120,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"591b57fd1faea7000400000a","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"591b58041faea7000400000b","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"591b58061faea7000400000c","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"591b580b1faea7000400000d","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afdc7f31666300023d0200/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"542e999a6331360002190600","type":"crops"},{"id":"542e9ae26331360002300b00","type":"crops"},{"id":"542ea1d36331360002861800","type":"crops"},{"id":"54afdca83166630002ac0200","type":"crops"},{"id":"58c9bddab7180c0004000043","type":"crops"},{"id":"58cf37cbbaf920000400005e","type":"crops"},{"id":"5970071587d9e9000400002a","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afdc7f31666300023d0200/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":6,"photo_associations_count":6,"plantings":[{"id":136,"garden_id":105,"crop_id":106,"planted_at":"2013-01-01","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2013-03-31T17:17:17.187Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:09.721Z","slug":"wisebird-inside-the-fence-leek","sunniness":null,"planted_from":null,"owner_id":72,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":72,"login_name":"wisebird","location":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"id":1571,"garden_id":671,"crop_id":106,"planted_at":"2014-02-09","quantity":48,"description":"Porvite, Autumn Giant 3, King Richard, Musselburgh, Lyon 2 (Prizetaker) - qty approx.","created_at":"2014-02-09T15:45:24.505Z","updated_at":"2014-02-09T15:45:24.505Z","slug":"tiggothy-kitchen-garden-leek--2","sunniness":"","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":485,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":485,"login_name":"Tiggothy","location":"Lake Vyrnwy, Mid Wales, UK","latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"id":1282,"garden_id":671,"crop_id":106,"planted_at":"2013-08-25","quantity":100,"description":"seeds sown indoors Feb / March 2013, pricked out into modules around May.

flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae that produces peppers. The Capiscum genus contains 20-27 species of peppers which vary in color, shape, size, and heat. 5 species are domesticated. Most peppers are green when unripe and change color as the fruit matures. The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants. Peppers have an upright growing habit and can benefit from staking to help the plant support the fruits.","row_spacing":50,"common_names":["Peppers","capiscum","poivron"],"guides_count":2,"binomial_name":"Capsicum","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors, transplant seedlings outside after hardening off","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59b9b55fdb28dd000400000a.jpg?1505342804","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59b9b55fdb28dd000400000a","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/55188abb35303400030a0000/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/55188abb35303400030a0000/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":7,"photo_associations_count":12,"plantings":[{"id":5168,"garden_id":13870,"crop_id":306,"planted_at":"2020-09-27","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2020-09-27T21:23:03.322Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T02:29:32.053Z","slug":"cas3y-my-old-lunchbox-capsicum","sunniness":"","planted_from":"","owner_id":1999,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1999,"login_name":"cas3y","location":"Whanganui a tara","latitude":-41.2887639,"longitude":174.7772239}},{"id":1512,"garden_id":1025,"crop_id":306,"planted_at":"2013-09-01","quantity":null,"description":"I have several varieties going, still too early to comment of their success.","created_at":"2014-01-20T01:10:08.089Z","updated_at":"2014-01-20T01:10:08.089Z","slug":"brooke-brooke-s-garden-capsicum","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"seedling","owner_id":794,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":794,"login_name":"Brooke","location":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","latitude":-35.2820709,"longitude":149.1286673}},{"id":5189,"garden_id":13870,"crop_id":306,"planted_at":"2020-10-26","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2020-10-26T22:39:00.679Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T22:45:16.746Z","slug":"cas3y-my-old-lunchbox-capsicum-6d716e64-ad72-4afb-a5a3-dd3af5b76c49","sunniness":"","planted_from":"","owner_id":1999,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":1999,"login_name":"cas3y","location":"Whanganui a tara","latitude":-41.2887639,"longitude":174.7772239}},{"id":1944,"garden_id":1358,"crop_id":306,"planted_at":"2014-08-26","quantity":null,"description":"Cherrytime (square pots) and Chocolate.

globe artichoke is a variety of a species of thistle cultivated as a food. The budding artichoke flower-head is the edible part of the plant. It is a cluster of many budding small flowers (known as an \"inflorescence\") and bracts on an edible base. Once the buds bloom the head becomes coarse and barely edible. Artichokes are perennials in Zone 7 and warmer. They normally produce edible flower-heads during their second year, but recent cultivars such as 'Imperial Star' have been bred to produce in the first year. Other cultivars, such as 'Northern Star', have been bred to overwinter in more northern climates. There are green and purple varieties of artichoke. They are often steamed, sautéed or braised, but can also be eaten raw.","row_spacing":90,"common_names":["Globe Artichoke","Annual Artichoke"],"guides_count":1,"binomial_name":"Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors.

a genus of herbaceous vines that have large edible orange flowers that mature into gourds or cucurbits. Squash are commonly divided into two main groups: summer and winter. Summer squash have shorter growing times, a bushy growth habit, tender skin, and are quite prolific. Common types include cucumbers, zucchini, and pattypan squash. Winter squash take longer to mature, have a more sprawling growth habit, and produce gourds with thicker skins that can be stored for a few months. Common winter squash are pumpkins, butternut squash, acorn, and delicata. Most squash transplant poorly. If starting from seed indoors, use peat pots that can be directly transplanted into the soil to reduce root disturbance. More growing information is available in individual species entries.","row_spacing":null,"common_names":["squash"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Cucurbita","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors or outdoors","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/54b4a9046130650002010000.jpg?1421125890","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"54b4a9046130650002010000","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afe46231666300023a1300/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"54afdbf33166630002760000","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54afe46231666300023a1300/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":8,"photo_associations_count":3,"plantings":[{"id":188,"garden_id":149,"crop_id":251,"planted_at":"2013-03-31","quantity":0,"description":"45 day zucchini from seed\r\n\r\nPlanted 3. 1 sprouted but was eaten by earwigs.

It is native to the temperate highlands and mountains of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, and Colombia. Feijoa is grown for it's fruits, which resemble small guavas, and as an ornamental. Feijoas are best planted from grafted saplings (as opposed to starting from seed) and will mature into a sprawling shrub if not pruned. They can also be grown in containers. They will produce fruit within 3-4 years of being transplanted. Most Feijoas are not self-fertile. The bright red flowers require pollination by 2-3 Feijoa trees of another variety nearby. The small fruit are green, ellipsoid, and the size of an egg. They taste like a cross between pineapple, apple, and mint, and have a clear, gelatinous seed pulp at the center surrounded by a firmer, slightly gritty opaque flesh. The fruit is eaten raw or added to smoothies. The edible flower petals can be added to salads. Fruit is best when allowed to ripen on the tree. A tarp or large cloth can be hung around the tree to catch fruit when it falls and prevent bruising. Feijoa requires between 100-200 hours of chilling during the winter and produces tastier fruit at moderate summer temperatures between 25-32°C. Summer temperatures above 32°C can negatively affect fruit set. Feijoa is somewhat drought tolerant.","row_spacing":200,"common_names":["Feijoa","pineapple guava","guavasteen","Brazilian guava","fig guava"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Acca sellowiana / Feijoa sellowiana","sowing_method":"Transplant grafted sapling","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5dc7b8edd232520004da8a3a.jpg?1573370093","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"5dc7b8edd232520004da8a3a","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"5dc7b8eed232520004da8a3b","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e5371870aed70004000023/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59e5371870aed70004000023/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":17,"photo_associations_count":22,"plantings":[{"id":3510,"garden_id":2478,"crop_id":81,"planted_at":"2012-12-01","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2016-12-01T08:45:43.973Z","updated_at":"2019-06-01T06:20:57.661Z","slug":"shiny-by-the-fence-feijoa","sunniness":"","planted_from":"","owner_id":15,"finished":true,"finished_at":"2019-06-01","lifespan":2373,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":15,"login_name":"shiny","location":"Wellington, NZ","latitude":-41.2887953,"longitude":174.7772114}},{"id":3450,"garden_id":6000,"crop_id":81,"planted_at":"2015-12-01","quantity":1,"description":"Planted out 8/1/2017","created_at":"2016-09-11T05:11:37.988Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T06:27:59.196Z","slug":"shiny-the-deck-feijoa","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"advanced plant","owner_id":15,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":500,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":14,"owner":{"id":15,"login_name":"shiny","location":"Wellington, NZ","latitude":-41.2887953,"longitude":174.7772114}},{"id":4352,"garden_id":4279,"crop_id":81,"planted_at":"2007-06-01","quantity":1,"description":"Right-hand of 2.

fava, or broad bean, is a species of flowering plant in the vetch and pea family Fabaceae. Unlike most beans, fava beans thrive in cooler weather and do not require trellising. They should be planted in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked. The broad, leathery pods contain 3-8 beans and grow on stiff stems that can reach heights of 1.8m.  Fava are planted for their edible beans, or as a cover crop to reduce winter erosion and increase nitrogen in the soil. Inoculants can increase yield and nitrogen production. The pods are commonly harvested while young, when they are about 15cm long. Fava beans are eaten in a myriad of ways: raw in salads, grilled, roasted, fried, pureed, and more.","row_spacing":12,"common_names":["broad bean","fava bean","faba bean","field bean","bell bean","English bean","horse bean","Windsor bean","pigeon bean","tic bean","tick bean"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Vicia faba","sowing_method":"Direct seed outdoors","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59252c5000d55700040000b5.jpg?1495608394","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59252c5000d55700040000b5","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59252c47adaf28000400002f/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59252c47adaf28000400002f/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":6,"photo_associations_count":5,"plantings":[{"id":4238,"garden_id":3444,"crop_id":80,"planted_at":"2019-04-26","quantity":20,"description":"Broad Bean - Early Long Pod (Mr Fothergill's brand sow by 2019)","created_at":"2019-04-26T04:14:30.076Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T03:15:06.299Z","slug":"bigblen-garden-fava-bean","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":2763,"finished":true,"finished_at":"2019-12-03","lifespan":221,"days_to_first_harvest":199,"days_to_last_harvest":221,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":5,"owner":{"id":2763,"login_name":"bigblen","location":"Rapaki Road, Christchurch","latitude":-43.5655489,"longitude":172.6637204}},{"id":4308,"garden_id":4230,"crop_id":80,"planted_at":"2019-05-20","quantity":null,"description":"","created_at":"2019-06-23T15:16:11.928Z","updated_at":"2019-06-23T15:16:11.928Z","slug":"ybvb-garden-fava-bean","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":3539,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":3539,"login_name":"ybvb","location":"43 Carr Street, South Perth","latitude":-31.9840808,"longitude":115.8658972}},{"id":64,"garden_id":55,"crop_id":80,"planted_at":"2013-02-23","quantity":12,"description":"","created_at":"2013-03-21T00:50:01.530Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:08.764Z","slug":"alittleheadache-containers-outside-fava-bean","sunniness":null,"planted_from":null,"owner_id":43,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":43,"login_name":"alittleheadache","location":"West Berkeley, CA","latitude":37.8689508,"longitude":-122.2968265}},{"id":2350,"garden_id":39,"crop_id":80,"planted_at":"2015-02-14","quantity":3,"description":"SW bed, 3 rows","created_at":"2015-02-14T14:47:59.613Z","updated_at":"2015-02-14T14:48:35.429Z","slug":"juliet-back-garden-bean-4b1e32cf-c8ce-4104-8aab-6ece9c280bc7","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":28,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":28,"login_name":"juliet","location":"London, UK","latitude":51.5073219,"longitude":-0.1276474}},{"id":2433,"garden_id":140,"crop_id":80,"planted_at":"2015-02-25","quantity":9,"description":"soaked for 3 days, planted in plastic starter pots.

Unlike other cucurbits like squash, cucumbers, and melons, Chayote's small gourds have a single, large, flattened seed or pit. Some varieties have spiny fruits. Chayote is native to Mesoamerica and thrives in a subtropical to tropical climate, although it can be grown in other regions in containers. It needs 120-150 frost-free days to reach harvest. Like cucumbers, it has a sprawling growth pattern and benefits from trellising - fruit will rot if it sits on the soil. It's pale green fruit can be 10-20cm long and resembles a flattened, wrinkled pear. It's green to white flesh has a mild taste like a cross between a potato and a cucumber. It is usually lightly cooked like summer squash. The tubers are starchy and eaten like potatoes. The shoots and heart-shaped leaves can be added to salads and stir-fries.","row_spacing":300,"common_names":["chayote","christophine","cho-cho","pipinola","pear squash","vegetable pear","choko","chinchayote","chayotextle","ichintal","güisquil","sou-sou","one-seeded cucumber"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Sechium edule","sowing_method":"Direct seed whole fruit outdoors","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59d3d18635bc1f0004000256.jpg?1507053954","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59d3d18635bc1f0004000256","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59d3d18935bc1f0004000257","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59d3d18c35bc1f0004000258","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e9cf16331360002f21000/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e9cf16331360002f21000/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":13,"photo_associations_count":3,"plantings":[{"id":1378,"garden_id":185,"crop_id":46,"planted_at":"2013-09-19","quantity":1,"description":"It's not quite mature enough for planting, but it was already perforated by bugs, so let's see if it survives.","created_at":"2013-09-19T23:18:14.404Z","updated_at":"2013-09-19T23:18:14.404Z","slug":"federicomenaquintero-back-garden-chayote--2","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"seed","owner_id":131,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":131,"login_name":"FedericoMenaQuintero","location":"Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico","latitude":19.5437751,"longitude":-96.9101806}},{"id":1131,"garden_id":185,"crop_id":46,"planted_at":"2012-08-21","quantity":2,"description":"Chayotes, if left to lie about, will start to germinate.

It is sometimes called the Butter Bean, which can also refer to the Lima Bean, a separate species. The Runner Bean differs from other beans in that it can be grown as a perennial where the ground does not freeze. Runner Beans are grown for their edible beans and as an ornamental: plants produce brilliant red flowers that attract hummingbirds and multicolored seeds. Some varieties have white flowers. The seed pods have a knife-like shape and are usually green, but some purple cultivars exist. Pods are 15-30cm long and contain 6-10 2.5cm seeds. Different varieties have different colored seeds. Seeds can eaten fresh or as dried beans, but must be cooked to remove toxins. Blooms can be added to salads. Young pods can be cooked like green beans. Roots are eaten by indigenous peoples in Central America. Runner Beans benefit from trellising.","row_spacing":20,"common_names":["scarlet runner bean","runner bean","butter bean","multiflora bean","Oregon lima bean","fire bean","mammoth","red giant","scarlet emperor"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Phaseolus coccineus","sowing_method":"Direct seed outdoors once soil temperatures are above 10°C","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5a1c9eb06dd6c00004000003.jpg?1511825055","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"5a1c9eb06dd6c00004000003","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5a1c9e9a2ae500000400002a/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"54afe46231666300023a1300","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/5a1c9e9a2ae500000400002a/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":5,"photo_associations_count":2,"plantings":[{"id":569,"garden_id":237,"crop_id":182,"planted_at":"2013-06-05","quantity":3,"description":"","created_at":"2013-06-05T02:40:44.707Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:15.965Z","slug":"unalmas-garden-runner-bean","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":null,"owner_id":167,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":167,"login_name":"Unalmas","location":"Somerville, MA","latitude":42.3875968,"longitude":-71.0994967}},{"id":1836,"garden_id":8,"crop_id":182,"planted_at":"2014-06-06","quantity":8,"description":"Seeds may be a little elderly, and the last lot I planted (from another packet) didn't come up at all.

Figs are native to the Middle East and western Asia and are grown for their fruit, which are also known as figs, and as an ornamental plant. In the right climate, they can grow as tall as 10 meters, but they can also be grown in containers and brought indoors in the winter in cooler regions. The plant has smooth white bark, deeply lobed fragrant leaves, and multiple, spreading trunks. Flowers are often pollinated by fig wasps, and develop into 3-5cm long fruit with green skin that, depending on the variety, can ripen to a deep purple. Figs need to ripen fully on the tree before harvest. They are ripe when they droop and are soft to the touch. If they ooze a white sap when they are pulled from the tree, they are not ripe. Fig trees have an aggressive root system that searches for groundwater in aquifers, ravines, and cracks in rocks. Once established, they can tolerate seasonal drought and are affected by few pests. Figs are propagated through cuttings or division, and generally produce fruit the year after planting. In warmer climates, they can produce two crops, one in early summer, and the other in fall.","row_spacing":500,"common_names":["common fig","fig","higuera"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Ficus carica","sowing_method":"Cuttings, young tree, or seeds","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8.jpg?1508284761","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59e6995ca4beeb00040000c8","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59e69963a4beeb00040000c9","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59e69967a4beeb00040000ca","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e999d6331360002290600/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"59e115e6c86acd0004000019","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/542e999d6331360002290600/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":2,"photo_associations_count":5,"plantings":[{"id":4262,"garden_id":3197,"crop_id":85,"planted_at":"2019-05-01","quantity":1,"description":"Had a hard winter, unclear if it will recover.

compartment of seeds at the bottom. Flesh is deep orange and firm with a sweet, nutty taste. Butternut squash becomes deeper orange and sweeter and richer as it ripens. Like other squash, it grows on sprawling vines. If starting seeds indoors, use peat pots and directly transplant them into the soil to reduce root disturbance. Harvest squash before any hard frosts and cure. Winter squash can be stored for up to 3 months in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place.","row_spacing":90,"common_names":["Butternut Squash","Butternut pumpkin","Gramma"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Cucurbita moschata","sowing_method":"Direct seed.

Catnip is used an ornamental, to make herbal tea, and as a companion plant. It is deer-resistant and attracts beneficial insects like bees and butterflies and deters pests like flea beetles, Japanese beetles, aphids, weevils, ants, squash bugs and mice. It also attracts cats because it contains the chemical nepetalactone, which can cause cats to enter a brief state of euphoria.","row_spacing":45,"common_names":["catnip","catswort","catmint"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Nepeta cataria","sowing_method":"Direct seed indoors before frost, or outdoors after last frost","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59bc51189a146200040000c8.jpg?1505513744","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"59bc51189a146200040000c8","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59bc511c9a146200040000c9","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59bc510df0ade1000400001e/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"576b864f9250090003000072","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/59bc510df0ade1000400001e/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":2,"photo_associations_count":6,"plantings":[{"id":1264,"garden_id":669,"crop_id":39,"planted_at":"2013-06-04","quantity":3,"description":"Thriving and taking over.","created_at":"2013-08-30T04:32:14.507Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T04:32:14.507Z","slug":"goatlady-herb-garden-catnip","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"seedling","owner_id":483,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":483,"login_name":"GoatLady","location":"Culpeper County, Virginia, US","latitude":38.491821,"longitude":-77.973865}},{"id":286,"garden_id":191,"crop_id":39,"planted_at":"2013-04-13","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2013-04-17T13:51:50.638Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:11.645Z","slug":"rai-bee-garden-catnip","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":null,"owner_id":136,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":136,"login_name":"Rai","location":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"id":538,"garden_id":237,"crop_id":39,"planted_at":"2013-06-05","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2013-06-05T02:25:27.569Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:15.478Z","slug":"unalmas-garden-catnip","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":null,"owner_id":167,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":167,"login_name":"Unalmas","location":"Somerville, MA","latitude":42.3875968,"longitude":-71.0994967}},{"id":868,"garden_id":288,"crop_id":39,"planted_at":"2012-06-01","quantity":1,"description":"","created_at":"2013-07-06T15:47:40.737Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:20.950Z","slug":"jadelennox-back-porch-catnip","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":null,"owner_id":200,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":200,"login_name":"jadelennox","location":"Massachusetts","latitude":42.3788774,"longitude":-72.0323659}},{"id":11,"garden_id":11,"crop_id":39,"planted_at":null,"quantity":1,"description":"Near the carport.

is a variety of mint that has a more delicate, sweet flavor than Peppermint.

Mint is often grown in pots to prevent it from overtaking the garden with its invasive, spreading rhizome root structure. The leaves are most aromatic before the plant flowers and can be used fresh, dried, or frozen. Mint's strongly scented leaves confuse the pests of carrots, tomatoes, alliums, and brassicas, and deter flea beetles.","row_spacing":null,"common_names":null,"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Mentha spicata","sowing_method":"Direct seed.

peach tree is a deciduous tree native to Northwest China that produces stone, or drupe, fruits. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus because their stones are corrugated rather than smooth. Peaches and nectarines are the same species - nectarines have a recessive gene that makes their skin smooth rather than fuzzy. Cultivated peaches are divided into two groups: clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not. Peaches can have white or yellow fuzzy skin. Yellow peaches usually have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness. White peaches are very sweet with little acidity. Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 °C during the winter, and hot temperatures in the summer to ripen fruit. Some varieties are self-pollinating, while others require pollination by a peach tree of another variety with the same bloom period within 50 feet. Peaches should be thinned to 7-12cm apart when fruit are 2-3cm in diameter to increase mature fruit size. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters.

Prunus. The Prunus genus also includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and peach. Within the subgenus Prunus, there are many species. The two largest species groups are European Plums (Prunus domestica) and Japanese Plums (Prunus salicina). Apricots are also classified as a section of the Prunus subgenus. The skin of plums can be coated with a waxy bloom or it can be shiny. Plums can be purple, green, yellow, or red. Shape varies from oval to globular. Plums can be dried to make prunes. European Plums require 800-900 hours of chilling during the winter, Japanese Plums require 300-500. Some varieties are self-pollinating, but all plum trees benefit from a pollination partner with the same bloom time within 15 meters. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 3-6 years of planting.","row_spacing":500,"common_names":["plum","prune"],"guides_count":0,"binomial_name":"Prunus","sowing_method":"Transplant bare-root plant","main_image_path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/54b4af6c6130650002060000.jpg?1421127529","sun_requirements":"Full Sun","growing_degree_days":null,"processing_pictures":0},"relationships":{"pictures":{"data":[{"id":"54b4af6c6130650002060000","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59b1dc3044d62e0004000009","type":"crops-pictures"},{"id":"59b1dc3344d62e000400000a","type":"crops-pictures"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54b4af4f6263370002060000/pictures"}},"companions":{"data":[{"id":"542e99656331360002070500","type":"crops"}],"links":{"related":"/api/v1/crops/54b4af4f6263370002060000/companions"}}}},"harvests_count":1,"photo_associations_count":6,"plantings":[{"id":4349,"garden_id":4278,"crop_id":161,"planted_at":"2006-01-01","quantity":1,"description":"Yellow flesh, red skin plum","created_at":"2019-07-09T08:24:46.068Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T08:24:46.068Z","slug":"bigblen-orchard-plum","sunniness":"semi-shade","planted_from":"advanced plant","owner_id":2763,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":2763,"login_name":"bigblen","location":"Rapaki Road, Christchurch","latitude":-43.5655489,"longitude":172.6637204}},{"id":1498,"garden_id":951,"crop_id":161,"planted_at":"2014-01-14","quantity":1,"description":"Victoria Plum, planted on the lawn.","created_at":"2014-01-15T08:34:52.221Z","updated_at":"2014-01-15T15:07:38.755Z","slug":"spring_rain-back-garden-side-bed-plum","sunniness":"sun","planted_from":"bare root plant","owner_id":725,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":725,"login_name":"spring_rain","location":"UK","latitude":54.7023545,"longitude":-3.2765753}},{"id":140,"garden_id":109,"crop_id":161,"planted_at":"2008-06-08","quantity":2,"description":"Plum - Mariposa\r\nPlum - Narabeen\r\n\r\nPlanted very close, intention being to keep them small.","created_at":"2013-04-01T23:59:34.232Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T00:37:09.768Z","slug":"shermozle-garden-plum","sunniness":null,"planted_from":null,"owner_id":76,"finished":false,"finished_at":null,"lifespan":null,"days_to_first_harvest":null,"days_to_last_harvest":null,"parent_seed_id":null,"harvests_count":0,"owner":{"id":76,"login_name":"shermozle","location":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"id":113,"garden_id":97,"crop_id":161,"planted_at":"2013-03-05","quantity":1,"description":"A duo plum - greengage and Victoria, I think.
